# ðŸ“Š Student Math Score Prediction

This project predicts students' math scores based on their study habits, including hours studied, homework completion, and class focus.
The goal is to understand how these factors influence academic performance and to provide specific study suggestions based on the model.

# ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Collect student data through a survey (hours studied, homework completion, focus level, past scores).
- Clean and process the dataset for machine learning.
- Build a predictive model (using regression) to estimate scores.
- Generate study improvement suggestions based on the model.
